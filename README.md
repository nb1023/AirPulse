## AirPulse 

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to leverage various machine learning approaches in developing a robust and accurate air quality forecast model. In addition to forecasting, the project includes the implementation of a preventive system that provides precautionary measures for both healthy individuals and those with cancer and respiratory diseases.

The study evaluates five prominent machine learning models to identify the most effective one. After thorough evaluation using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), R2 score, and mean squared error (MSE), the Random Forest model emerged as the most effective. The performance metrics for Random Forest were as follows: a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.719, a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.35, and an impressive R2 score of 0.998. Other models considered in the study include decision trees, XGBoost, artificial neural networks (ANN), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).

In a bid to enhance user awareness, the project also aggregates real-time news related to air quality. This feature is particularly beneficial for individuals staying informed about current environmental conditions and potential health concerns.
